        <h1 class="  text-xl text-black lg:text-3xl py-2">Q1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <h3><span class="font-bold"> var :</span> Variables declared with var can be reassigned within the same scope. This means you can change their values after the initial assignment. They are also hoisted to the top of their scope, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
        </h3>
        <h3><span class="font-bold"> let :</span> Variables declared with let can also be reassigned within the same scope. they are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to the block in which they are defined.
        </h3>
        <h3><span class="font-bold"> const :</span>Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. They are also block-scoped. it's important to note that while the variable itself cannot be reassigned, the value it holds can still be mutable if it's an object or an array.

        <h1 class="  text-xl text-black lg:text-2xl py-2 ">Q2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <h3><span class="font-bold"> null :</span>
            null is used when the value does not exist, when you do not want to reject a default value.
        </h3>
        <h3><span class="font-bold"> undefined :</span>
            undefined  value does not exist, it Used when a variable is not set to a value or a function does not return a value.
